# Help Desk System

## This is a simple CLI program that acts as a help desk system.

## There are 3 types of users(CUSTOMER, MANAGER, and SERVICER)

The customer can create tickets with issuses.
The manager views those tickets and assigns them to a servicer.
Once a servicer fixes the issue they update the ticket to resolved/isFixed.
